# Automatically normalize line endings for all text-based files

* text=auto

# ==============================================================================
# For the following file types, normalize line endings to LF on check-in and
# prevent conversion to CRLF when checked out. This helps prevent
# newline-related issues, such as those caused by running a local build script.

.*      text eol=lf
*.js    text eol=lf
*.json  text eol=lf
*.md    text eol=lf
*.yml   text eol=lf
